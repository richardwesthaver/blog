* Overview
UI is a hot topic in the programming world. Nowadays it is expected
that production apps have multiple 'frontends' each supporting a
certain kind of UI. Here are some of the ones we care about:
- Web GUI
  Runs in a web browser
- Native GUI
  Runs natively using host OS or graphics hardware directly
  - OS-based
  - bare-metal
- CLI
  Runs at a shell prompt
- Modular \\
  Runs a combination of the above types, usually configurable at
  run-time and with a separate backend service.

Our goal is to establish footholds in these areas of UI development
with our in-house libraries. We do this by creating a generic UI
protocol and implementing it for the various types above.
