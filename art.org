#+TITLE: Art
Art is one of the crowning achievements of man-kind and is worth
understanding. Although there are many interesting examples of /works
of art/, they're not what we're after.

Here, we discuss Art in a very metaphysical fashion. We treat it as a
means of debate: Philosophy. Our goal is not to form a deeper
appreciation of works of art, but instead to /pilfer/ the methods and
techniques which make works and apply them to our own
processes. Although appreciation often occurs as a result of studying
the Philosophy of Art, this is merely a side-effect. The building
material is far more valuable.
